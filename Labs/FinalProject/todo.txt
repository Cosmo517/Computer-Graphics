Core Features:

1. Collision Detection
    1. Already "implemented" but might want to improve. Currently using sphere collider
3. Need a goal of some kind. Maybe a prize or artifact.
    1. Figured it out, just need to implement the textures
4. Need 3 enemies
    1. One will patrol back and forth
        1. Wizard
    2. One will randomly move once it hits a wall
        1. Night Warrior
    3. One will randomly move and periodically shoot a bullet at the player (either a sprite or 3d object)
        1. Necromancer
    5. If you get hit with 5 bullets, you restart the level
    6. Each monster has different HP. When hit by the heroes bullets, it takes one damage
        1. Monster explodes/dies when it reaches 0 HP



Extra Credit:


2. Create a title menu
    2. Needs to have player options. Maybe different weapons, or variable health/difficulty
3. Create sound effects
    1. Found sound effects. 
    2. Change the monster sound
    3. Change explosion sound to match fireball
4. Create at least three levels
    1. Use an array based implementation. Load the level from an array, where
        different values mean different things. I.e. 1 = wall1, 2 = wall2, 3 = enemy1 effects
5. Include a story (optional)
