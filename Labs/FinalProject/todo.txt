Core Features:

1. Textures:
    1. Floor
    2. Wall 1
    3. Wall 2
2. Collision Detection
    1. Already "implemented" but might want to improve. Currently using sphere collider
3. Directional Light
    1. Setup in the shader, though it breaks things... I believe thats because i dont have one setup yet
4. 10 point lights
    1. Setup in the fragment shader, though I need to make some sort of light object
5. Need a goal of some kind. Maybe a prize or artifact.
    1. Texture?
6. Need 3 enemies
    1. One will patrol back and forth
    2. One will randomly move once it hits a wall
    3. One will randomly move and periodically shoot a bullet at the player (either a sprite or 3d object)
    4. If a bad guy collides with you, you restart the level
    5. If you get hit with 5 bullets, you restart the level
    6. Each monster has different HP. When hit by the heroes bullets, it takes one damage
        1. Monster explodes/dies when it reaches 0 HP
    7. The below are subject to change but just ideas
        1. Wizard
        2. Necromancer
        3. Knight
7. Player needs to be able to "shoot"
    1. Pressing space bar shoots a bullet (either a sprite or 3d object)
8. Level will be stored in array based format



Extra Credit:

1. Simulate monster animation by using 3 textures and swapping between them
    1. Already found *possibly* the sprites to use
2. Create a 3 frame texture for an explosion (to represent a monster dying)
    1. Already found the sprites to use I think
3. Create a title menu
    1. Play button needs a texture
    2. Needs to have player options. Maybe different weapons, or variable health/difficulty
4. Create sound effects
    1. Probably find some online
5. Create at least three levels
    1. Use an array based implementation. Load the level from an array, where
        different values mean different things. I.e. 1 = wall1, 2 = wall2, 3 = enemy1 effects
6. Include a story (optional)
