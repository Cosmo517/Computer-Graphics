Core Features:

1. Collision Detection
    1. Already "implemented" but might want to improve. Currently using sphere collider
3. Need a goal of some kind. Maybe a prize or artifact.
    1. Figured it out, just need to implement the textures

Extra Credit:

2. Create a title menu
    2. Needs to have player options. Maybe different weapons, or variable health/difficulty
3. Create sound effects
    1. Found sound effects. 
    2. Change the monster sound
    3. Change explosion sound to match fireball
4. Create at least three levels
    1. Use an array based implementation. Load the level from an array, where
        different values mean different things. I.e. 1 = wall1, 2 = wall2, 3 = enemy1 effects
5. Include a story (optional)
